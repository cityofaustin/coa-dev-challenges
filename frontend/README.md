# Frontend Challenge

### Challenge

Your task is to create a webpage that displays the schedule for pools and splash pads in Austin. This is an open‐ended challenge, so feel free to show off your creativity. This data comes from our Open Data Portal. For documentation, visit: https://data.austintexas.gov/Recreation-and-Culture/Austin-Pool-Schedule/xaxa-886r

### To get started:

- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Run a local server: `yarn start`
- Find `TODO:`s in the code and build from there.

### Resources

- Endpoint to data: https://data.austintexas.gov/Recreation-and-Culture/Austin-Pool-Schedule/xaxa-886r
- SODA Developers Documentation: http://dev.socrata.com/
- React Hooks: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
- Us. If you are stuck, or need guidance, leave a comment to a line of code in Github or email us.

### Some Hints & Guidelines

- You must work on this alone. Do not share the code challenge with others.
- Make you site responsive ‐ this should display well on mobile too.
- Write clean code. Bonus points for tests.
- The boilerplate uses React Hooks. They are fairly new, so if you're unfamiliar with them you're welcome to use classic lifecycle methods instead (render, componentWillMount, etc). That being said, React Hooks doesn't take long to pick up and it makes a lot of that data lifecycle management easier. So it might be worthwhile to give it a try. :)
